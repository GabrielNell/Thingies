# Thingies
Thingies Repository

## Practice

1. Fork and clone down this respository
1. Open Thingies.pde in Processing.
3. Run the program. You should get an error message that says `The field Thingy.myX is not visible` because the *client* code in `setup()` is trying to access `private` member variables.
4. Fix the program by 
  * finishing the four setter and getter functions in `Thingy.java`
  * rewriting the *client* code in `setup()` to use the four setter and getter functions
5. The finished program should print `Distance between bob and mary is 56.568542`
1.  Edit the files in Github to reflect the working version.
